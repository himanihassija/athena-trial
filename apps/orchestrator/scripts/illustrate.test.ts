/**
 * Tests for Athena's diagram path (see board/boardAgent.ts, classroomController.ts).
 *
 * Three failure modes, none of which a live run would show reliably:
 *
 *  - The same spoken turn reaching `applyControl` twice, once from the
 *    agent-history poll and once from the relayed RTM transcript. Without the
 *    guard that is two Excalidraw round trips and the same diagram pasted
 *    beside itself. This is the illustrate analogue of the quiz suite's
 *    duplicate-payload tests.
 *  - A model returning something that is not a usable diagram spec — fenced
 *    JSON, prose in front of it, edges pointing at nodes it never defined.
 *    Each of those has to degrade to "no diagram" rather than to a broken one.
 *  - New elements landing on top of what is already on the board.
 *
 * Run with: node --env-file=.env --import tsx scripts/illustrate.test.ts

 * return in `ingestTranscript`, and `upsertByTurn` parses the text only to keep
 * the spoken half, so the payload was dropped and `applyControl` was never
 * reached. Quizzes never showed this because the agent-history poll delivers
 * them a second way; a diagram has only the relay.

/**
 * Tests for turn-taking enforcement (see classroomController.ts).
 *
 * `hasSpeakPermit` used to be a fixed-duration TTL (15s), and the case that
 * mattered most here was a legitimate answer running long past it — ASR
 * settle + LLM generation + a genuinely long spoken response — and getting
 * cut off mid-sentence because enforcement re-validated the permit's
 * timestamp on every state-change event, even ones well after the turn had
 * already, correctly, begun. `authorizedTurnInProgress` fixed that half.
 *
 * The other half was the same bug one step earlier: a reasoning model can
 * take upwards of 20 seconds just to make its FIRST thinking/speaking
 * transition, and a fixed TTL cut that off too — before the turn had even
 * begun, for a permit that was never superseded by anything. A permit is
 * now valid for as long as it still is the invitation it was: nobody has
 * spoken again since it was granted. There is no duration left to tune.
 *
 * Time is faked by rewinding `speakPermit.grantedAt` and by moving
 * `floor.lastHumanSpeechAt` directly, rather than sleeping; these run in
 * milliseconds and still exercise real elapsed-time and event-ordering logic.
 *
 * Run with: node --import tsx scripts/floor.test.ts

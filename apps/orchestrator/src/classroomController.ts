 * long as nothing has since made it not the answer to the most recent thing
 * said.
 *
 * So validity is judged by that instead: has anyone spoken again since the
 * permit was granted. If not, it is still exactly the invitation it was, no
 * matter how long the engine takes to act on it — wait for her. If someone
 * has, the room has moved on and a reply this stale would be answering

 * revoke an invitation outright already does, explicitly and immediately,
 * by calling `clearSpeakPermit` — mute, teacher barge-in, the floor closing
 * to students, a quiz that never landed.
 *
 * "Has anyone spoken again" turned out to need one more qualification, found
 * live: a turn commonly relays more than once — the recogniser settling on a
 * final version, or simply arriving twice — and `lastHumanSpeechAt` refreshes
 * on every relay, finished or not, because the silence-gap detector and the
 * floor indicator both need it to (a teacher mid-sentence must never read as
 * silent). A permit granted off the FIRST relay of an address then read every
 * later relay of that SAME utterance as fresh evidence someone else had
 * spoken, and revoked itself — measured live, within about a second of being
 * granted, on the very address that granted it. The fix is not to slow that
 * refresh down (`lastHumanSpeechAt`'s other consumers depend on it staying
 * fast); it is to also ask WHICH turn the latest speech belongs to.
 * `lastHumanSpeechTurnId`, tracked in parallel, answers that: if it names the
 * same turn the permit itself was granted for, the timestamp moving on is not

/**
 * ConvoAI agent lifecycle — PS31 §3.1 (agent joins the live classroom),
 * §3.3 (barge-in), §3.6 (spoken quizzes), §3.10 (teacher override actions).
 *
 * Wraps the `agora-agents` SDK. The live `AgentSession` object must be held in
 * memory to call `interrupt()` / `say()` / `think()` / `update()` on it — which
 * is the concrete reason the orchestrator is a long-lived process rather than
 * serverless functions.
 *
 * Configuration follows the official Next.js quickstart's `invite-agent` route.
 * The classroom-specific changes are:
 *   - `remoteUids: ['*']` so the agent hears every participant, not just one
 *     requester (§3.1 multi-party).
 *   - `skipPatterns: [5]` on TTS, opening the brace control channel (§3.6, §3.9).
 *   - `idleTimeout: 0` so the agent does not drop out of a quiet classroom.
 *   - semantic end-of-speech, so a teacher pausing mid-explanation is not read
 *     as end-of-turn without charging every ordinary turn a fixed 2s wait.
 *   - `interruption` in keyword mode, so only someone addressing Athena by
 *     name can cut her off — not a scraping chair or a student's aside.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO Selective Attention Locking (SAL) here. A `sal`
 * block used to be sent, but `advanced_features.enable_sal` never was, and
 * Agora documents that flag as what turns the feature on — so nothing was
 * separating voices and the comments claiming otherwise described behaviour
 * that had never run. Enabling it properly is not the fix either: the join
 * schema states `sal.sample_urls` supports "Only one voiceprint URL", so
 * `recognition` mode can enrol exactly one speaker, which a classroom of
 * rotating students cannot use. Cross-talk is therefore a known, unmitigated
 * property of this deployment rather than a solved problem.
 *
 * The LLM is Agora's resold gpt-4o-mini. No OpenAI key is involved anywhere in
 * this project: speech recognition, the model and the voice are all billed
 * through the Agora project.

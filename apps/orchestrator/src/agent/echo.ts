/**
 * Self-echo filtering — protects against Athena's own TTS being picked back up
 * by an open mic and misread as a human turn.
 *
 * This matters for exactly the setup the plan assumes is common: a teacher and
 * students in the same physical room on laptop speakers rather than headphones.
 * Athena's voice comes out of a speaker, a nearby mic picks it up, Deepgram
 * transcribes it, and without this it arrives at `ingestTranscript` looking
 * exactly like a student said it — which can misfire the gap detector, or worse,
 * coincidentally contain her own name and cause her to answer herself.
 *
 * Ported from the pattern in a sibling Agora ConvoAI project (a game-show host
 * whose TTS leaks into three open contestant mics for the same physical reason),
 * adapted to this project's session-scoped, in-memory state rather than a
 * global keyed store — this project already threads `ClassroomSession` through
 * every call, so there is no need to key by an external room code.
 *
 * The core lesson carried over from that project's own bug history: a boolean
 * "is this an echo" is not enough. A mixed turn — the echo captured mid-sentence
 * while a student answers over it — contains both, and discarding the whole
 * turn throws the real answer away with the echo. So this returns the
 * *remainder* after subtracting whatever matches recent agent speech, not a
 * yes/no.
